      <p>
        The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing
        on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website,
        which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to
        your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server
        so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.
      </p>
      <p>
        First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie
        is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other
        than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other

        interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet
        browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear
        your browser’s cache. The "help" feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how
        to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable
        existing cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache. For more information about cookies

        when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized
        advertisements on the Website.

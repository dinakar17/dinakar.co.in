Hey everyone, My name is Dinakar. I am currently doing my final year at National Institute of Technology, Calicut. 

I like to work on projects that are related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am also interested in working on projects relevant to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In short I am a Machine Learning enthusiast and I am into any domain
that machine learning offer its solution in.

Besides technical stuff, I enjoy playing cricket and reading books (I read Harry Potter series twice!). I also like to explore new technologies that sprung up in the recent years like Blockchain, IoT, etc. A regular tweeter and a blogger, I like to share my knowledge with others.

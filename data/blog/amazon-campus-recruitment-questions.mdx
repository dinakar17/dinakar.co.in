In August 2022, Amazon conducted a coding contest examination on our campus as part of its recruitment efforts.

And the following two problems were asked.

# Problem 1

### Statement
**Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer K, the task is to delete K continuous elements from the array such that the sum of the remaining element is minimum. Return the minimum sum.**

```
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {10, 4, 3, 13, 2, 7}, K = 3 
Output: 17
Delete 13, 2, 7 and the sum of the remaining 
elements will be 17 which is the minimum possible.
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 12, 4, 5}, K = 1 
Output: 12
Delete 12 and the sum of the remaining 
elements will be 12 which is the minimum possible
```
This is one of the problems in the set of [Sliding window problems](https://leetcode.com/tag/sliding-window/).

Here's a [similar problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-after-k-consecutive-deletions/#:~:text=Given%20an%20array%20arr%5B%5D,remaining%20elements%20of%20the%20array.&text=elements%20will%20be%203%20which%20is%20maximum%20possible.) to the above question

### Approach
1. Calculate the sum of the first K elements (This is equivalent to creating a new window of size k)
1. Then start sliding the window across the array i.e., update the sum by subtracting the first element and adding the next element to the window
1. Most Importantly, keep track of the maximum sum of the window and its starting index 

```cpp:Solution.cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int minSumAfterKDeletions(vector<int>& nums, int k){
    int n = nums.size();
    int curr_sum = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) curr_sum += nums[i];
    int max_sum = curr_sum, idx = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < n-k; i++){
        // This below step means we're sliding the window by one step each time
        curr_sum = curr_sum - nums[i] + nums[i+k];

        if(max_sum < curr_sum){
            max_sum = curr_sum;
            // Note: The starting of the current window is "i+1"
            idx = i+1;
        }
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < idx; i++) ans += nums[i];
    for(int i = idx+k; i < n; i++) ans += nums[i];

    return ans;
}
```

# Problem 2

### Statement
**Assume a size N array and an integer K. Find the minimal number of array groups that will have a difference less than or equal to K among the elements in the group. Simply put, you need to find the minimum group of arrays with a difference less than k.**

```
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {1, 13, 6, 8, 9, 3, 5}, K = 4 
Output: 3  
3 Minimum groups are possible. Those are {13}, {6, 8, 9}, {1, 3, 5}
Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 2}, K = 3
Output: 3 
3 Minimum groups are possible. Those are {1, 2, 4},  {5, 6}, {8, 9}
```

### Approach
Once the array is sorted, this problem becomes trivial, since all we have to do now is compare the smaller element with every other element to ensure their differences are less than k. 


```cpp:Solution.cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int minGroupsLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k){
    int n = nums.size();

    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int start = nums[0];
    int cnt = 1; // default answer is 1 for if array has just one element

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        if(nums[i] - start <= k) continue;
        else{
            start = nums[i];
            cnt++;
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}
```

Hope you learned something.  Congratulations on persevering to the end. I look forward to seeing you on another blog soon!

```

## Reasons behind the Error
You can see from the highlighted line in the above error that node.js is trying to find the file in an invalid directory instead of `node_modules` directory

This could probably occur due to a number of reasons and the following could be one of them
- If you've not installed node in your local computer
- Could potentially occur due to some .js files with same names in different directories, which were in the same main directory.



**Note: If you want to reproduce the error, run the following command**

```shell
node thisFileDoesnotexists.js
```


## Fix #1: Replace using "npm" with "yarn"
1. Make sure you've installed the latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (For good reasons, it's better to have the latest node version, regardless of whether you have an older one.)
1. Then install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) and make sure to delete `package-lock.json` (Since this file is produced by npm during "npm install") file.
1. Finally run `yarn` in the correct directory where your `package.json` file exists.
```shell
> yarn 
```

## Fix #2: Remove and Reinstall npm and node
    This fixes a lot of issues/bugs that are producing this error in the first place.

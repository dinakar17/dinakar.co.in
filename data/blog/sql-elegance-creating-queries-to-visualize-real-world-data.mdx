This blog will be about how I have written SQL queries on a real-world dataset. Before delving deeper into nitty-gritty details, the one thing I think one should comprehend before writing SQL queries is this:

"Imagine trying to navigate a foreign city without a map. Similarly, attempting to retrieve valuable information from your data without understanding its underlying structure is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Understanding the data and how it is stored across different tables is the key to unlocking the true power of your data. Without it, you'll wander aimlessly and waste valuable time and resources writing meaningless SQL queries”

So, In short, Understanding the underlying data is the ultimate to being able to write useful SQL queries.

Without any further ado, let’s get started!

## Dataset I’ve dealt with

The dataset I’ve exercised on is [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?resource=download). Basically, this is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 and scraped by [rgriffin](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37).

    In a nutshell, it consists of two .csv files. One named “athlete_events.csv” incorporated info about each row that corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). The file contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fnbCo6CLeMxXh9mOSmayewCR7rnLKe6RHCMBZhgw5K4B4i1N5HaI20gLjBfJLOtefsEUqu-QEs__u6aHz5ap4-XfkXp9lOt9koNxiFVbGn1BJR4L05NwcdkyWulq7eDTvpakbkvpke8ausmzwDAKQNX04eo1wlWu95sYGw2ZwHNEt9Ma0ZvjKPoLAhltpw)

Another is named “‘noc_regions.csv” including info about noc and corresponding regions along with notes. The file contains 231 rows and 3 columns.

A Note on NOC:

A National Olympic Committee (NOC) is an organization that represents a country in the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The NOC is responsible for organizing, promoting, and developing the Olympic Movement in their respective countries, including selecting and training teams to participate in the Olympic Games. Each country has one NOC, which is recognized by the IOC. NOCs work closely with their national government and other sports organizations to promote the Olympic values and ideals within their country.

## Perplexing Problems that Persisted

#### **Problem 1: `Please configure the PostgreSQL Binary Path in the Preferences dialog.`**

Fixed by setting proper PostgreSQL Binary path (By the way I’ve used PostgreSQL to execute SQL queries). With the help of the files present in the **bin** SQL queries gets executed.

#### Problem 2: CSV file Header error

Solved by enabling the headers option. Since the CSV file has headers as its first row.

Fixed by choosing double quotes (“) as an escape character

## Writing SQL Queries

#### Checking the Database we’re currently resided in

```sql
SELECT current_database()
```

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RyrD4c9zAG05f3bgCV6yKA6Hi_sU_VRhRROVnSGSDJfwkjzSREYQWCznd6nZ_snpzaY4uU1zcE4WDrHt8AKWNL5WfHVdYfnBfbheMHUJHRbkeKnEyZn45rLCd_pPwzuMqZWbl3-d_Zo_ZrIyeIfc9edXhkCI-GmD0irP-NLIwgCbCmDl8XKLBSUn-Seqbg)

#### Dropping (if exists) and Creating two tables to load in the csv files

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS OLYMPICS_HISTORY;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS OLYMPICS_HISTORY
(
	id INT,
	name VARCHAR,
	sex VARCHAR,
	age VARCHAR,
	height VARCHAR,
	weight VARCHAR,
	team VARCHAR,
	noc VARCHAR,
	games VARCHAR,
	year INT,
	season VARCHAR,
	city VARCHAR,
	sport VARCHAR,
	event VARCHAR,
	medal VARCHAR
);


DROP TABLE IF EXISTS OLYMPIC_COMMITTEES;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS OLYMPIC_COMMITTEES
(
	noc VARCHAR,
	region VARCHAR
);
```

#### Query 1: How many olympics games have been held?

Info to understand: Games happen utmost twice in an year (Winter and Summer).

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT games) AS olympic_games FROM olympics_history;
```

**Explanation:**

Here is what each part of the query does:

- SELECT: This keyword is used to select the columns from the table you want to retrieve data from
- COUNT(DISTINCT games): This function counts the number of unique values in the "games" column. The DISTINCT keyword is used to make sure that the same value is not counted multiple times.
- AS olympic_games: This is used to give an alias name to the output column resulting from the count(distinct games) function.
- FROM olympics_history: This keyword specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.

The query will return one row with one column, named "olympic_games", that contains the number of unique values in the "games" column of the "olympics_history" table.

It's worth noting that, the COUNT() function does not count NULL values, so if there are any NULL values in the "games" column, they will not be included in the count.

**Result:**

#### Query 2: List down all Olympics games held so far

**Info:** Sorting out uniquely the rows with unique values of both year and season and then sort the results by the year will yield our desired results. Note that sorting by unique city values will mislead since a city might host olympic games more than once.

```sql
select distinct year, season, city from olympics_history order by year;
```

Here's what each part of the query does:

- SELECT DISTINCT: This keyword is used to select only the unique values in the "year" and "season" columns.
- year, season, city: These are the columns that you want to retrieve data from.
- FROM table_name: This keyword specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.
- ORDER BY year: This clause sorts the result set by the "year" column in ascending order.

Here’s another alternative SQL query

```sql
select year, season, city from olympics_history group by year, season, city order by year;
```

**Miscellaneous: How GROUP BY statement works**

![Image about how "group by" statement works](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ld6bUOkp-v4SN6RyKOwWKI-D8MGX2b_qxanRu7CO543QUvfN-xDIFjYSkGbfKJSVw-odYoc4WzF3YzXaL0LyLy-H4RWolnApkJyJJn0ytMhfwiDFfUSansBKtTS7mi-qwuMkG0fTlaXbvyYPY8nq-BO75aZSox2EsaKdjWdPXQu4g5INQXsu895z4JUIRA)

#### Query 3: Mention the total no of nations who participated in each Olympics game.

```sql
select games, count(distinct noc) from olympics_history group by games;
```

Here’s the alternative query along with explanation:

```sql
    with all_countries as
        (select games, nr.region
        from olympics_history oh
        join olympic_committees nr ON nr.noc = oh.noc
        group by games, nr.region)
    select games, count(1) as total_countries
    from all_countries
    group by games

    order by games;
```

**Explanation:**

- `With all_countries as (...)`: This subquery creates a table with two columns “games” from “olympics_history” and “region” from “olympics_committees” tables respectively. Then the corresponding rows in the resultant table (“games” and “regions”) are filtered based on “noc” columns in the both tables. Next, rows are again filtered based on unique combinations of “games” and “region”
- `Select games, count(1) as total_countries from all_countries group by games;`: This query first selects “games” column and “count(1)” returns the count of number of rows. The rows of the resultant table are further filtered out using unique “games” rows and corresponding count(1) changes too. And then on the result is sorted by “games” column.

	from all_countries

	   first_value(total_countries) over(order by total_countries_in_each_game)
	  ) as lowest_countries
,
concat(first_value(games) over(order by total_countries_in_each_game desc), ' - ',
	   first_value(total_countries) over(order by total_countries_in_each_game desc)
	  ) as highest_countries

Note:

- The use of the WITH clause should always be at the start of the query, before the main SELECT statement.
- Using two SELECT keywords simultaneously will result in a syntax error. Instead, you can use subqueries or CTEs to achieve the same results.
- In the ORDER BY clause, you should use the name of the column from the current table. In the WHERE clause, you should use the name of the column from the previously created table or subquery.
- Comparison of values between rows in a table is usually done through the use of aggregate functions and GROUP BY clauses, rather than comparing each row to every other row.
